My app is connected to the spotify web -api, you can create a account with your email and a password of your choosing.
After that you can redirect your self to the music home page where u will see a search bar, look for any artist or song you wish,
after your search you will see images that you can click on under the artist row, clicking on the artist of your choosing will bring up 
the artist page and you will see that artist top hits and play them or add them to a palylist,
on the same page after you added songs to a playlist you will see a buttom in the middle of the page near the nav bar you can search for single songs and other artist
